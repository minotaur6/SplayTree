Splay Tree is a self-adjusting BST (Binary Search Tree).
It follows the same principles.
They are also balanced trees and use rotations to get balanced. 
Unlike AVL trees they are not completely balanced which is good feature of these trees as it is easier to search for recent items in this tree.
This data structure is widely in building caches where you need to access the recently used items.
